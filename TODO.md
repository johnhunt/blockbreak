### TODO

* Add collision detection for blocks
* Make game end if ball moves lower than paddle
* Add scoring
* Fix block colours
* Make blocks vanish on collision
* Look into using canvas animate to improve performance (may not be possible)
* - or, use requestanimationframe: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.requestAnimationFrame
* Make ball X velocity change based on where it hits the paddle to make the game more fun
