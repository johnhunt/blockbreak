Git notes:

1. Enable colours!
git config --global color.ui true

- Github docs are wrong, there is no write with https (or at least I can't create a new branch on github with that protocol..) - use ssh
Funny stuff:
1. To set up an existing repo with existing files (eg empty repo with existing project on local macine) set origin to the remote repo

Creating new branches on remote repo:

Note: when you git push origin it'll update all branches on origin that exist there
