Git notes:

1. Set up your username:
git config --global user.name "John Hunt"
git config --global user.email "johnrhunt@gmail.com"

1. Enable colours!
git config --global color.ui true

- Github docs are wrong, there is no write with https (or at least I can't create a new branch on github with that protocol..) - use ssh
Funny stuff:
1. To set up an existing repo with existing files (eg empty repo with existing project on local macine) set origin to the remote repo

Creating new branches on remote repo:
http://www.mariopareja.com/blog/archive/2010/01/11/how-to-push-a-new-local-branch-to-a-remote.aspx

Note: when you git push origin it'll update all branches on origin that exist there

Beware: This looks worse than it is:

john@helium:/var/www/streetrage/public$ git checkout experimental
M       index.html
Switched to branch 'experimental'

But nothing has really changed as you haven't committed anything. If you change branches again without stashing/committing etc the un-committed changes will follow you around until you commit, stash or revert them.

error: You have local changes to 'GIT_NOTES.txt'; cannot switch branches. -
